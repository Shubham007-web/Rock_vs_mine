# Sonar Rock vs Mine Prediction
- Sonar (sound navigation and ranging) is a technique based on the principle of reflection of ultrasonic sound waves. These waves propagate through water and reflect on hitting the ocean bed or any object obstructing its path.
- Sonar has been widely used in submarine navigation, communication with or detection of objects on or under the water surface (like other vessels), hazard identification, etc.
- The CSV files contain data regarding sonar signals bounced off a metal cylinder (mines — M) and a roughly cylindrical rock (rock — R) at various angles and under various conditions.
- In this model I used Logisitic Regression for classifying prediction, whether Mine or Rock.
- The accuracy of prediction is above 80% on test data.
